# ✅ EXTRACTED CONTENT MERGED INTO STRUCTURE

## What Was Done

✅ **Merged extracted PDF content** into the 6-chapter Matematica structure:
- Restored 6 chapters with 51 lessons
- Added extracted content to 12 lessons (all geometry lessons from Chapter 6 + 2 from Chapter 1)
- 12 lessons now have rich summaries + images

## Merge Results

**Successful Matches: 12 lessons**
- Chapter 1: 2 lessons
- Chapter 6 (Geometry): 10 lessons

**No extracted content yet: 39 lessons**
- These keep their original summaries (from before extraction)
- Located in Chapters 2-5

## Example: Chapter 6, Lesson 3

Now has:
- **Summary**: 2,229 characters (from PDF)
- **Images**: 60 images (from PDF extraction)
- **Sections**: 1 section (can be split if needed)
- **Content**: Definitions, examples, explanations from manual

## Files Updated

✅ `curriculum_structure.json` - Merged version
✅ `frontend/public/curriculum_structure.json` - Synced to frontend

## What to Test Now

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache (again)
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + Delete`
- Select "All time" → Check "Cookies and cached files" → Clear

### Step 2: Hard Refresh Browser
- Go to: `http://localhost:3000`
- Press: `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Step 3: Navigate to Geometry Lessons
- Navigate: Clasa V a → Matematica
- Click: Chapter 6 "Elemente de geometrie și unități de măsură"
- Click any lesson (e.g., Lesson 3 "Lungimea unui segment")

### What You'll See
✅ **Lesson with extracted content:**
- Rich summary text (2,229 chars)
- Images from PDF (60 images)
- Content with definitions and examples
- Better educational content!

## Next Phase (For All 51 Lessons)

To add content to all 51 lessons, we would need to:
1. Re-extract from the PDF properly (mapping to all 51 lessons)
2. Or manually add content to the remaining 39 lessons
3. Then repeat the merge

For now, **test the 12 lessons that have content** to verify they display correctly!
