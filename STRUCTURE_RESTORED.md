# ✅ STRUCTURE FIXED - RESTORED TO 6 CHAPTERS

## What Went Wrong
I accidentally flattened the Matematica structure from:
```
6 Chapters → Lessons (proper structure)
```

To:
```
13 flat lessons (wrong structure)
```

That's why you saw CAP 1-9 incorrectly displayed.

## What I Fixed
✅ Restored the proper Matematica structure:
- **Chapter 1: Operații cu numere** - 13 lessons
- **Chapter 2: Metode aritmetice** - 5 lessons
- **Chapter 3: Divizibilitatea** - 3 lessons
- **Chapter 4: Fracții ordinare** - 10 lessons
- **Chapter 5: Fracții zecimale** - 9 lessons
- **Chapter 6: Elemente de geometrie și unități de măsură** - 11 lessons

**Total: 6 chapters with 51 lessons**

## Files Updated
✅ `curriculum_structure.json` - Restored proper structure
✅ `frontend/public/curriculum_structure.json` - Synced to frontend

## What to Do Now

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache Again
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + Delete`
- Select "All time" → Check "Cookies and cached files" → Clear

### Step 2: Hard Refresh Browser
- Go to: `http://localhost:3000`
- Press: `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Step 3: Check Matematica
- Navigate: Clasa V a → Matematica

You should now see:
✅ **6 Chapters (CAP 1-6)** instead of 9
✅ Proper lesson names
✅ Correct structure restored!

## What's Next
The proper PDF extraction with content and splits can wait - first we need to have the right structure. The curriculum is now back to its correct form.

When you're ready, we can:
1. Merge the extracted content into this proper structure
2. Add sections/splits to individual lessons (if desired)
3. Ensure all 51 lessons have rich content from PDF
