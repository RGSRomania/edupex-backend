```bash
cd /Users/mdica/PycharmProjects/EduPex/backend && git push -f origin main
```

Paste in terminal and press Enter.

### Method 3: Step by Step (Most Control)

**Command 1:**
```bash
cd /Users/mdica/PycharmProjects/EduPex/backend
```

**Command 2:**
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
```

**Command 3:**
```bash
git push origin main
```
